 Optoelectronic and Quantum Technologies Master's Student at the University of Bristol and External Researcher at Politecnico di Torino.

A computer network scientist researching analytical, numerical, and event-based simulations of co-existing quantum-classical networks. Demonstrated delivery of related software tools for subtopics like CV-QKD rates, reconfigurable bandwidth networks, and a novel noise model capturing the impact of classical noise on polarization-encoded qubits.
